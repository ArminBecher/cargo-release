Performs release best-practices, including:

* Ensure the git working directory is clean.
* Bump the version in Cargo.toml
* Run `cargo publish` ([if not disabled](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-publish--field-optional))
* Create a git tag for this version
* Bump version for next development cycle
* `git push`

## Install

Current release: 0.12.4

`cargo install cargo-release`

## Usage

`cargo release [level]`

* See the [reference](docs/reference.md) for more on `level`, other CLI
  arguments, and configuration file format.
* See also the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for help in figuring out how to adapt
  cargo-release to your workflow.

### Prerequisite

* Your project should be managed by git.

### Dry run

We recommend calling `cargo release --dry-run` with your custom options before
actually executing it. The dry-run mode will print all commands to
execute during the release process. And you will get an overview of
what's going on.

Here is an example.

```
 $ cargo release --dry-run
cd .
git commit -S -am (cargo-release) version 0.18.3
cd -
cargo publish
Building and exporting docs.
cargo doc --no-deps
cd target/doc/
git init
cd -
cd target/doc/
git add .
cd -
cd target/doc/
git commit -S -am (cargo-release) generate docs
cd -
cd target/doc/
git push -f git@github.com:sunng87/handlebars-rust.git master:gh-pages
cd -
git tag -a 0.18.3 -m (cargo-release)  version 0.18.3 -s
Starting next development iteration 0.18.4-pre
cd .
git commit -S -am (cargo-release) start next development iteration 0.18.4-pre
cd -
git push origin --follow-tags
```
